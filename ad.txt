Version 2.00 of emDEX is now available, including a new sizeable marker edit window 
with user-defined formatting buttons and font control.

emDEX is a FrameMaker™ Plug-In, adding a real-time visual means of watching your
index grow right before your eyes to help you track and modify your index entries on the
fly. No more need to tag-and-generate again and again.

A demo version is available from the website at http://www.emdex.ca
